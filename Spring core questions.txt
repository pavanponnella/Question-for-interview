1. What are the design patterns?
  ans. Design patterns are used for best practises for writing code.
       ex:Factory Design, Micro design
2. Monolith vs Microservices architecture?
 ans. All functionalities are developing as single page are called Monolith arc.
      Developing functionalities as a small comoponents are called Microservices arc.
              ex: product, cart extc..
3.What is framework?
 ans. Frame work is a semideveloped software.[ It provides common logic which are required for application developement. ]
       ex: Hibernate,structs, spring etc...
4.what is Hibernate: 
 	ans It an ORM framework used to develop presistance layer.(CRUD)
5.what is Structs : 
	ans It is a web framework used to develop web layer.
6.what is Spring:
       ans. By using Spring we can develop end to end.
7.Spring Advantages?
  ans. 1.free and open source and light weight.
       2.it is versatile( adjustable easely for other framework )
       3.it is an non- invasive (it won't force to use any interface)
       4.Spring works on POJO and POJI model.
8. Note : Spring is loosely coupled 
9. What is inheritance and composition.
   ans. inheritance: creating new class for existing class called inheritance.
        Composition: creating an object of a class is called Composition.
10. Note : If you use inheritance and composition both are tightly coupled.
11. Spring core: 
   ans. Spring core suggests developer to follow "strategy design" pattern to develop classes, for loosely couple.
12. what is Strategy Design pattern?
   ans. it comes under behavioural design pattern.
        Rules:
              1.Favour composition over inhertance.
	      2.Code to interface instead of implementation classes.
              3.Code should be open for extension and closed for modification.
13.Note: Instaed of talking directly implementatin talk with interfaces.
14.What is Dependency Injection.? 
   ans. The process of intecting one class object into another class is called Dependency injection.
